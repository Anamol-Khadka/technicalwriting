      <h2>Dunkin’ on Campus: Reducing Donut & Coffee Waste</h2>
      <p>
        At a campus Dunkin’, staff noticed that a lot of donuts and coffee were thrown away at the end of each day.
        They weren’t sure how demand was being predicted, so they decided to track it themselves.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>They recorded donuts and coffee sold each hour.</li>
        <li>They noted day of week and special events (game days, exams).</li>
        <li>They measured how many items were left over at closing time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Cause–effect:</strong> After two weeks, they saw that early afternoons were much slower than mornings.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They reduced donut production in the slow hours.</li>
        <li>They brewed smaller coffee batches later in the day.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As a result, waste dropped while sales stayed stable. The prediction was simple: “mornings are strong, afternoons are weaker,” but putting numbers behind it made the change feel safe and reasonable.
      </p>

      <h2>Local Café: Planning for Fridays vs. Tuesdays</h2>
      <p>
        A neighborhood café assumed that “every day is busy.” When they checked their data, they discovered big differences.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fridays averaged 150 pastry sales.</li>
        <li>Tuesdays averaged only about 80 pastry sales.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Using this pattern, they used predictive analytics in a simple way: instead of baking the same 120 pastries every
        day, they prepared closer to 150 on Fridays and 80–90 on Tuesdays.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Result:</strong> Less pastry waste on Tuesdays and fewer sold‑out situations on Fridays.</p>

      <h2>Online Shop: Predicting Holiday Demand</h2>
      <p>
        A small online store selling custom phone cases wanted to prepare for the holiday rush without over‑ordering.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>They pulled last year’s daily order data for November and December.</li>
        <li>They spotted spikes during Black Friday week and the first two weeks of December.</li>
        <li>They noticed a sharp drop after December 20th.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With these patterns, they ordered extra stock for the peak weeks and reduced orders for the slower late‑December days.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> It’s like learning which bus is always crowded and planning your travel time around it.</p>
