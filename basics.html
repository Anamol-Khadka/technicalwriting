      <div class="definition-box">
        <strong>Definition (classification):</strong> Predictive analytics is a type of data analysis that uses past information
        (such as previous sales, busy hours, or seasons) to make informed guesses about what is likely to happen next.
      </div>

      <h2>The Big Picture in Plain Language</h2>
      <p>
        Think of predictive analytics like a weather forecast — but for your business. Weather experts look at past
        weather patterns and current conditions to estimate tomorrow’s temperature. In the same way, a business can look
        at past sales and customer patterns to estimate what they should prepare for next week.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Beginners Should Care</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You move from guessing to making decisions based on real numbers.</li>
        <li>You can explain your choices to coworkers, managers, or professors with simple charts.</li>
        <li>You build a skill that most large companies already rely on daily.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Terms (With Examples & Analogies)</h2>

      <h3>1. Data</h3>
      <p><strong>What it means:</strong> Raw information your business or project produces.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Donuts sold per day, coffee cups per hour, number of website visitors.</li>
        <li><strong>Analogy:</strong> Data is like ingredients in your kitchen — you need them before you can cook anything useful.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Pattern</h3>
      <p><strong>What it means:</strong> A trend or behavior that repeats or stands out over time.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> Sales jump on Fridays and dip on Tuesdays.</li>
        <li><strong>Cause–effect:</strong> If you see this, you might make more items for Fridays and fewer for Tuesdays.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Forecast</h3>
      <p><strong>What it means:</strong> A prediction or estimate about the future based on past data.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> “The last three Fridays averaged 140 donuts, so we’ll prepare about 145 this Friday.”</li>
        <li><strong>Analogy:</strong> It’s like planning how much rice to cook based on how much your family usually eats.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Model</h3>
      <p><strong>What it means:</strong> A repeatable rule or tool that turns data into a forecast.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> A spreadsheet formula that averages the last four Tuesdays and suggests how much to make next Tuesday.</li>
        <li><strong>Classification:</strong> Models can be simple (averages, trends) or advanced (machine learning). This site focuses on simple, beginner‑friendly models.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="note-visual">
        Visual idea: Show three boxes in a row labelled “Past Data” → “Simple Model/Rules” → “Prediction for Next Week.”
      </div>

      <h2>From Raw Data to Better Decisions</h2>
      <p>
        Predictive analytics does not magically “know” the future. Instead, it uses what already happened to make a
        smarter guess than pure intuition.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You collect past data (what already happened).</li>
        <li>You look for patterns (days, seasons, or events that change demand).</li>
        <li>You define a simple rule or model to forecast the future.</li>
        <li>You compare predictions to reality and adjust your rules over time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Over weeks and months, this cycle turns basic data into a practical advantage for your business or class project.
